This program is used to upload text files to a GUI in order to display a sales report. For this specific sales report, I chose to simulate a fast food establishment. The report displays a table that lists 6 menu items and 6 restaurant locations. There is a button to upload the .txt file containing the sales data, as well as an option to copy the file after uploading. After uploading the data, the total amount of money earned for each menu item is displayed, as well as the total amount of money earned by each of the locations, along with the total amount of money earned for the company. The sales report also identifies which location had the highest and lowest amount earned for each menu item. The highest is highlighted in green, and the lowest is highlighted in red. Each location receives a bonus based on the amount of sales for each menu item. For every menu item a location earned the most money in, they receive an extra $5,000 bonus. If a location earned the least amount of menu in a category, they receive an extra $1,000 bonus. If a location didn't have the highest or lowest ina category, thn they get a $2,000 bonus. The total bonuses for each location is displayed, as well as the total bonuses for all of the locations combined. There are 2 JUnit tests I attached that were used to test the program. JavaFX is required to run the GUI.
